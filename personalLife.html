        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but spent most of my childhood in the suburbs. My passion for technology led me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Northern Illinois University, followed by a Master's degree in Computer Science from Roosevelt University in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Life took an exciting turn when I met my beautiful wife on a cruise to the Bahamas. We tied the knot at the most magical place on earthâ€”Disney World. Now, we call the charming town of Saint Charles, Illinois, home, where we enjoy a peaceful life just 35 miles west of Chicago. Our amazing son, Keegan, is currently pursuing his dreams in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I love staying active with outdoor activities like golf, tennis, swimming, and even a bit of light carpentry. But above all, my greatest joy comes from spending time with my family and friends, creating memories that last a lifetime.</p>
